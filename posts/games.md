# Single phone party games

- [guess](https://guess.tducasse.com): monikers/time's up like game. No timer, no teams, just for fun without keeping score.
- [heads up](https://headsup.tducasse.com): put the phone in front of you, the others try to make you guess the word.

# Prototypes and proof of concepts 
Some games I just never finished ðŸ˜¬

- a card game (think hearthsone/magic/yu-gi-oh), multiplayer (peer to peer). Code [here](https://github.com/tducasse/poc-card-game).
- a turn-based multiplayer strategy game, with a server using websockets. Code [here](https://github.com/tducasse/poc-turn-based).
- a very simple roguelite that really goes nowhere. Code [here](https://github.com/tducasse/poc-roguelite).

# Finished games
Sometimes I join [game jams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam), and I publish my games on [Itch.io](https://tducasse.itchio).
