# Finished games
I've joined a few [game jams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam), and I published my games on [Itch.io](https://tducasse.itchio).

# Game Dev related projects
Find all of them on [GitHub](https://github.com/tducasse?tab=repositories&q=gamedev)

# Single phone party games
Games made quickly for when you want to have fun in a group ðŸ˜„
- [guess](https://guess.tducasse.com): monikers/time's up like game. No timer, no teams, just for fun without keeping score.
- [heads up](https://headsup.tducasse.com): put the phone in front of you, the others try to make you guess the word.
