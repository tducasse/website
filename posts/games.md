# Single phone party games

- [guess](https://guess.tducasse.com): monikers/time's up like game. No timer, no teams, just for fun without keeping score.
- [heads up](https://headsup.tducasse.com): put the phone in front of you, the others try to make you guess the word.

# Prototypes and proof of concepts 
Some games I just never finished ðŸ˜¬

- a card game (think hearthsone/magic/yu-gi-oh) I'm currently working on with a friend, nowhere near done, and not open source _yet_
- a turn-based multiplayer strategy game, with a server using websockets. Code [here](https://github.com/tducasse/poc-turn-based), app deployed [here](https://aldevs.gitlab.io/gamedev/projectv3/)
- a very simple roguelite that really goes nowhere. Code [here](https://github.com/tducasse/poc-roguelite), app deployed [here](https://aldevs.gitlab.io/gamedev/projectv2/)
